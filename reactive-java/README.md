# Reactive Java
## Using Project Reactor Io Java Library.

This is just a little fun, Reactive Java is still just Java. 

The point here is to focus on a `reactive` way of solving problems. Though the language
is still OO/imperative in intent, attempt to solve problems using non-blocking functional 
and reactive approaches.
