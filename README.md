Exercising in improving software development through practise and repition.

# about

* These are from katas on [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/).
* Intention to build the starting point for a collection of common and interesting languages and styles.

I intend to build the coverage of katas in the same style. With the `master` branch containing `katas` and `koans` to be solved and another branch for `solutions`. There is huge crossover of ideas between different languages and paradigms, this is a way of exploring those.

# languages i'd like to be stronger in

Rank is from the [tiobe-index March 2019](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), this stackify article [influential programming languages 2018](https://stackify.com/popular-programming-languages-2018/) is also intersting. And considering this [report](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/3-emerging-trends-tech-leaders-should-watch) from o'reilly.
