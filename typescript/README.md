# Code Kata TypeScript

TypeScript basically is JavaScript, it is transpiled like for like to JavaScript and the same libraries are usable.
However, TypeScript is not JavaScript and familiarity with this language is useful for working with Angular.

## To be clear:
* TypeScript is created by Microsoft.
* It is most frequently used in Angular projects, that is a Google framework.
* Here we are testing it using Jest, by Facebook.
* And all code here is written in WebStorm by JetBrains.
* The license is MIT?

## How to:

Jest tests rely on transpiled javascript files existing. To run the tests:
```
npm test
```

*NB* There need to be transpiled code for this to work.
